The International Monetary Fund swiftly downgraded its U.S. growth forecast, citing rising economic uncertainty and widespread supply chain disruptions stemming from the new measures. Economists now warn of a looming "Voluntary Trade Reset Recession," with small businesses expected to bear the brunt of rising input costs. Still, the tariffs have spurred a wave of domestic investment: Hyundai Motor Company announced $21 billion in U.S. manufacturing commitments through 2028, including plans to boost annual domestic production to 1.2 million vehicles. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the strategy as a form of "strategic uncertainty" aimed at pressuring global partners to renegotiate trade imbalances."""
